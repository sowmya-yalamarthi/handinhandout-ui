## Proposal for HAND-IN HAND-OUT
- We are proposing the technology stack based on JAVA with spring, and the front end with Angular.
 
### Backend language + framework 
- The backend language and framework we are using for our project would be **JAVA / Spring**
- It is a fully optimized frame work which helps to maintain and modify requirements.

### Backend free app host 
- The Backend app host for our project would be **HEROKU**
### Data host 
- The data host we are planning to use is **PostgreSQL**
### Front-end page plan 
- The front end page we have planned for our project is Build with **Angular**
- which is used to build single page applications which maintains the same view while navigating to other pages.  
### Front-end responsive design
